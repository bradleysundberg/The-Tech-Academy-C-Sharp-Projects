# The Tech Academy C# Projects

This repository contains my C# console application projects from The Tech Academy. These projects were built in Visual Studio as part of drills and exercises to practice C# fundamentals.

## Projects

The following files demonstrate small programs and drills that cover basic C# concepts:

- **Anonymous Income Comparison Program** — Compare two incomes.
- **Arrays** — Practice arrays and array operations.
- **Boolean Comparison Program** — Simple boolean logic output.
- **Car Insurance Approval Program** — Conditional statements using user input.
- **Income Comparison Program** — Compare user input values.
- **Shipping Quote Program** — Simple calculation of a shipping quote.
- **DR.cs** — (Add a brief description once finalized.)

(Each file in this repository represents a small console project from Tech Academy lessons.)

## About

These projects were created to learn and demonstrate the use of C# fundamentals including variables, loops, conditionals, arrays, user input, and basic problem solving.

Each file should be run as a console app within Visual Studio.
