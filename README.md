# The Tech Academy C# Projects

This repository contains my C# console application projects from The Tech Academy. These projects were built in Visual Studio as part of drills and exercises to practice C# fundamentals.

## Projects

The following files demonstrate small programs and drills that cover basic C# concepts:

* [Anonymous Income Comparison Program](https://github.com/bradleysundberg/The-Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main) — Compare two incomes.
* [Arrays](https://github.com/bradleysundberg/The-Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Arrays.cs) — Practice arrays and array operations.
* [Boolean Comparison Program](https://github.com/bradleysundberg/The-Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/blob/main/Boolean%20Comparison%20Program.cs) — Simple Boolean logic output.
- **Car Insurance Approval Program** — Conditional statements using user input.
- **Income Comparison Program** — Compare user input values.
- **Shipping Quote Program** — Simple calculation of a shipping quote.
- **DR.cs** — (Add a brief description once finalized.)

(Each file in this repository represents a small console project from Tech Academy lessons.)

## About

These projects were created to learn and demonstrate the use of C# fundamentals, including variables, loops, conditionals, arrays, user input, and basic problem solving.

Each file should be run as a console app within Visual Studio.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
2. Open the folder in Visual Studio.
3. Set the project as a C# console application.
4. Build and run each file to see the output in the console.

## Notes

- Files are named according to the concept or drill they cover.
- These were created in Visual Studio as part of The Tech Academy training.
